# TREE DATA STRUCTURE IN CPP

## DESCRIPTION

My implementation of trees in C++.

&nbsp;

## CONVENTION

1. Respects the clean code.
2. Respects the simplicity over the complexity.
3. Respects the organization over the algorithms.
4. Focuses on high performance, code reuse, code maintenance.

Plus, by using C++:

- Due to portability, **each module is fully presented in a single file**.
- **Prefers C++ pointers** to C++ references (because C++ pointers are compatible with other common programming languages).
